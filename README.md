## What is intent? What are different types of intent?

Intents are the standard messaging mechanism in Android that expresses the userâ€™s intention to perform some work. They allow you to interact with other components defined by you or by the Android operating system.

**Implicit intent**
Implicit Intents do not directly specify the Android components which should be called , it only specifies action to be performed.
e.g. `Intent intent = new Intent(ACTION_VIEW,Uri.parse("http://www.google.com");`

**Explicit intent**
Explicit intents are used in the application itself wherein one activity can switch to other activty.
`Intent intent = new Intent(this,TargetActivity.class);`

**Pending intent**
A PendingIntent specifies an action to take in the future. It lets you pass a future Intent to another application and allow that application to execute that Intent as if it had the same permissions as your application.
